    "* Finding the number of cancelled flights for every airline per weekday.\n",
    "* Finding the number and percentage of cancelled and diverted flights for every airline per weekday. \n",

    "One of the most fundamental tasks during a data analysis involves splitting data into independent groups before performing a calculation on each group.  The powerful **groupby** method, which allows you to group your data in any way imaginable and apply any type of function independently to each group before returning a single dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of the groupby method is to perform an **aggregation**. What actually is an aggregation? In our data analysis world, an aggregation takes place when a sequence of many inputs get summarized or combined into a single value output. For example, summing up all the values of a column or finding its maximum are common aggregations applied on a single sequence of data. An aggregation simply takes many values and converts them down to a single value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we will need to know just a little terminology. All basic groupby operations have **grouping columns**, and each unique combination of values in these columns represents an independent grouping of the data. In addition to the grouping columns, most aggregations have two other components, the **aggregating columns** and **aggregating functions**. The aggregating columns are those whose values will be aggregated. The aggregating functions define how the aggregation takes place. Major aggregation functions include *sum, min, max, mean, count, variance, std, and so on*."
